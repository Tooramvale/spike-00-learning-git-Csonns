Spike Plan
==============

**Name**: "Alex Sonneveld <alex.sonneveld@live.com.au>"

## Context:
Source Control or (Revision Control) is common tool used to keep track and
contribute to the history present in all open sourced or enterprise software
projects.

**Knowledge/Skill/Technology Gap:**
The developer is not aware or familiar with Source Control tools, in particular
Git. In order to progress with future Spikes and code development, it is highly
recommended they have some basics skills / knowledge of Git.

## Goals/Deliverables: [GIT REPOSITORY (CODE)] + [SPIKE REPORT]

You need to download this Git repository as a Git repository, add your Spike
report that details what you have learn about Git during this process, commit
the report and then upload the difference via the same Git repository.

Your report should include all the steps involved with **Git** use to complete
this Spike (within reason, since you may need to upload twice to detail how you
uploaded the initial time). This may include, but limited to:

- Installing Git,
- _"Downloading"_ this Git repository,
- _"Saving"_ your report to Git, and
- _"Uploading"_ this Git repository

**Planned start date:**  2017/02/28
**Deadline:**  2017/03/06

## Planning notes:
- Review the provide links below, especially [Try Git][Try Git]
- Record notes on the different Git commands and explain what they do in your
  own words (where possible)
- Install Git on your system (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc)
- Try downloading some one else's Git repository (not just from GitHub)
- Try uploading your own repository to multiple `remote` (like BitBucket)
- Upload your finished report (in Markdown preferred) and provide a link

**Extras / Bonus Points:**
- What other social Git platforms are there?
- What other Source Control programs are there?
- Try merging two existing repositories (they can be both new repositories)
- What are some recommend practices? e.g. Branching model, commit messages, etc
- Commit your work to a `develop` branch
